I've decided to make my resume in HTML/CSS, and I'm hosting it on GitHub
because GitHub is great.  You can find the resume in the following places:

* [Web Version](https://harsha509.github.io/my-resume/)
* [PDF Version](http://harsha509.github.io/my-resume/Sri%20Harsha%20Resume.pdf) (use this version for printing)

Please note that the web version was built for modern browsers and is best
viewed in either Chrome, Safari, iOS, or Android (though it has been tested
in Firefox and works alright there too).
